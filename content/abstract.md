This paper examines existing Linked Data interfaces to statistical datasets and introduces Loqu, a platform for data exploration and visualization. Loqu allows users to search datasets by linked concepts, detects and allows editing of dataset dimension metadata, and provides a graphical tool to create Vega visualizations. While other systems generally store and process observation data in RDF formats, enabling more complex queries, Loqu employs the CSV and Apache Arrow tabular formats for observation data and the RDF Data Cube vocabulary for metadata, resulting in a scalable, low-cost deployment model. To this end, Loqu includes over 700 million data series published by statistical organizations around the world, as collected by the open-source DBNomics project. Loqu also allows users to semantically annotate and visualize externally hosted public datasets in one tool. Loqu presents a solution that emphasizes ease of use, simple deployment, and openness, and thus aims to provide a useful starting point for open data users.
